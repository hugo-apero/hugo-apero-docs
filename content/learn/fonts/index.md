As with [color themes](../color-themes), you can completely customize your site's fonts within minutes of creating a new site. How you do it depends on how much control and customization you need.

## Embedded fonts

Hugo Apéro includes 6 embedded fonts that work "out of the box." We selected 3 serif and 3 sans-serif options that we thought looked good with this theme, in our humble opinions. All embedded fonts include [real italics](https://www.marksimonson.com/notebook/view/FakevsTrueItalics) so you may <em>emphasize</em> to your <em>heart's</em> content :heart:! How to choose?

You may choose fonts for headings and body text in your site's `config.toml` file. Scroll down to find:

```toml
[params]
  <!--snip snip-->
  # use an embedded font-family
  # serif options: Fraunces / EB Garamond / Bitter
  # sans-serif options: Commissioner / Atkinson Hyperlegible / Metropolis
  # if you import your own fonts, name them here too
  customtextFontFamily = "Commissioner"
  customheadingFontFamily = "Fraunces"
```

Here are the links to each font so you can see them in action:

<h6 class="ttu tracked pv3 bt">Embedded font options</h6>
    <table class="collapse ba bw1 b--moon-gray mv4 w-100">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th class="f6 fw6 tl ttu pa3">Serif options</th>
          <th class="f6 fw6 tl ttu pa3">Sans-serif options</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr class="stripe-dark">
          <td class="pa3"><a href="https://fraunces.undercase.xyz/">Fraunces</a></td>
          <td class="pa3"><a href="https://github.com/kosbarts/Commissioner">Commissioner</a></td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="stripe-dark">
          <td class="pa3"><a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/EB+Garamond">EB Garamond</a></td>
          <td class="pa3"><a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Atkinson+Hyperlegible">Atkinson Hyperlegible</a></td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="stripe-dark">
          <td class="pa3"><a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bitter">Bitter</a></td>
          <td class="pa3"><a href="https://fontsarena.com/metropolis-by-chris-simpson/">Metropolis</a></td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

## Use attractive system fonts

Alternatively, you may want to use a system font, which you know will be rendered reliably across languages, operating systems, and browsers. Apéro uses [Tachyons](https://tachyons.io) to render beautiful system font stacks for your site, making it super simple to configure and blazing fast to load. The default choices are `sans-serif` or `serif`, and can be assigned to headings and body text, respectively. Additional options can be found in the [Tachyons Font Family Reference](https://tachyons.io/docs/typography/font-family/). Why use system fonts?

>  Relying on systems fonts greatly improves page performance and can also help your web application/site blend in with the user’s operating system. Readability is strongly linked to familiarity, so this helps create a more fluid reading experience, allowing your users to focus on your content.

Here is a step-by-step, using the `config.toml` file:

+ Leave both `customtextFontFamily` and `customheadingFontFamily` blank (with empty quotes, or comment out the line entirely).

+ Just below those keys, select a `textFontFamily` and `headingFontFamily` from the options listed [here](http://tachyons.io/docs/typography/font-family/). All values are lower case, and exclude the `.` in front. 

```toml
[params]
  <!--snip snip-->
  # use an embedded font-family
  # serif options: Fraunces / EB Garamond / Bitter
  # sans-serif options: Commissioner / Atkinson Hyperlegible / Metropolis
  # if you import your own fonts, name them here too
  customtextFontFamily = ""
  customheadingFontFamily = ""
  
  # alternatively, leave empty and select basic font options: sans-serif or serif
  # for more http://tachyons.io/docs/typography/font-family/
  textFontFamily = "sans-serif"
  headingFontFamily = "serif"
```

For example, you may choose:
```toml
  textFontFamily = "courier"
  headingFontFamily = "baskerville"
```

And your site would look like:

## Use a custom font

Alright alright alright. So you still want to use your own fonts. You'll need to do a bit more work to get this working, but not too much. If you made it here, I'm going to hope that you know a bit more about [self-hosting fonts](https://www.tunetheweb.com/blog/should-you-self-host-google-fonts/).

Here are the steps:

+ Create a `static/fonts/` folder, and add the actual font files you'd like to embed to that folder. To download Google fonts, there is a [popular app](https://google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com/fonts) to help you. Select a font, then download the zip file containing the font files you'll need to embed.

+ Create an `assets/` folder in the root of your website project (don't add it to your `themes/` directory!).

+ Create a file named `custom.scss` in the new `assets/` folder to define the [`@font-face` CSS rule](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face) for each font/weight combination you downloaded. For example, here is a `custom.scss` that imports the [Nanum Myeongjo font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nanum+Myeongjo). The [webfonts helper app](https://google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com/fonts) will help write your CSS for you (using `../fonts/` to customize the folder prefix correctly by default), like this:

```scss
/* nanum-myeongjo-regular - latin */
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Nanum Myeongjo';
  font-style: normal;
  font-weight: 400;
  src: local(''),
       url('../fonts/nanum-myeongjo-v15-latin-regular.woff2') format('woff2'), 
       url('../fonts/nanum-myeongjo-v15-latin-regular.woff') format('woff'); 
}
```

Your final step is to go back to your `config.toml` file and add the `font-family` values for the font(s) you want to use to the `customtextFontFamily` and/or `customheadingFontFamily` keys. You can combine custom fonts with system fonts too. 

```toml
[params]
  <!--snip snip-->
  # use an embedded font-family
  # serif options: Fraunces / EB Garamond / Bitter
  # sans-serif options: Commissioner / Atkinson Hyperlegible / Metropolis
  # if you import your own fonts, name them here too
  customtextFontFamily = ""
  customheadingFontFamily = "Nanum Myeongjo"

  # alternatively, leave empty and select basic font options: sans-serif or serif
  # for more http://tachyons.io/docs/typography/font-family/
  textFontFamily = "sans-serif"
  headingFontFamily = ""
```

Here is what this could look like (thanks to workshop participant [Issac Lee](https://github.com/issactoast)!)

If you do all this, you have my consent to delete the theme's `static/fonts/` folder that holds all the custom embedded fonts so you aren't carrying those unnecessary files around with your site (do not delete the `static/webfonts/` folder- that holds the [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/)!).

For example, let's examine the 3 commits necessary to make [this magic](https://google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com/fonts/hachi-maru-pop?subsets=latin) happen:

### Commit #1
